YouTube Channel Growth and Viewer Preference Analysis

In this project, I utilized the YouTube Data API v3 to extract channel data using a channel key. The project involved two main analytical approaches:

Time Series Analysis: I applied Holt-Winters technique to forecast the growth of the YouTube channel. This method allowed for accurate predictions by considering trends and seasonality in the data.
Viewer Preference Analysis: I used the Random Forest technique on the captions of the videos to analyze viewersâ€™ collective preferences. This approach helped in understanding the factors that influence viewer engagement based on video captions.
