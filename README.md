YouTube Channel Growth and Viewer Preference Analysis

In this project, I utilized the YouTube Data API v3 to extract channel data using a channel key. The project involved two main analytical approaches:

Data Extraction: The project uses the YouTube Data API v3 to extract data from a YouTube channel using a channel key. This includes various metrics such as views, likes, comments, and more.
Time Series Analysis: After fetching the data, the project employs Holtâ€™s Winters technique for time series analysis. This method helps in forecasting the growth of the channel by analyzing historical data and identifying trends and seasonal patterns.
Caption Analysis: The project also uses the Random Forest technique to analyze the captions of the videos. This analysis helps in understanding the collective preferences of viewers based on the captions, providing insights into what kind of content resonates more with the audience.
Visualization and Reporting: The project includes detailed visualizations and reports to present the findings. These visualizations help in making the data more accessible and understandable, allowing for better decision-making regarding content strategy.
