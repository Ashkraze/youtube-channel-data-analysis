# youtube-channel-data-analysis
In this project I used YouTube Data Api v3 to extract channel data using channel key, after fetching data I have used Holt'z winters technique for Time Series Analysis to forecast growth of the Channel, I have also used the Random Forest Technique on the captions of the videos to analyze the viewers collective preferences depending on the caption.
